Log:
- 10/17/2018: Initial checking - Sync with v2.0.1 mbed Cloud Client API release (mbedOS 5.10.1)

Note: If building using a local toolchain:
- use the supplied "build-k64f.sh" script to build the application + bootloader
- if using the online IDE, you can disregard as this will happen automatically

K64F mbed Cloud Note:
- In order to use mbed Cloud, the K64F must have an SD-CARD inserted (2GB or larger)
